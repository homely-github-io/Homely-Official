			<p>The purpose of the Homely website is to give insights for customers on brands identity. Within the website, the user can learn about the company's values, vision and the team behind it. What is more, the website is also functioning as a webstore where customers could easily purchase the candle of their likings just in few simple clicks. By combining both informative and purchasing function of the website, we are keeping it simple and easily accessible for the client to navigate through our platforms, get to know us better as a company and make a purchase all at one place, just a few clicks apart. </p>
          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Design elements and their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Homely colour scheme:<em>&nbsp;</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #ABC4AB;"></span> <em>#ABC4AB and </em> 
			<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #727D71;"></span> 
              #727D71
              <em>Green is a color that represents new beginnings and growth, therefore we have chosen it as a part of our color scheme as our product is for those who took a step towards the change, setting a start to their new beginning abroad. What is more, after conducting solution interviewes with our target audience, a majority of them have mentioned that when they think of their home country, the first thing that pops up in their minds is the nature, therefore it is the first color they associate with a memory from back home.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #A39171;"></span> <em> #A39171 and </em>
				<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #6D4C3D;"></span>
              #6D4C3D
              <em>Brown colors represent security and safety. We have chosen those colors because our brand is creating a save space for expats that reminds them of home.</em>
            </li>
	<li>
	<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DCC9B6;"></span>
              #DCC9B6
              <em>The vanilla color is a homely color that is mostly used within the home interior industry. It is not only because of design choices, vanilla is the aroma that is the strongest smell we all remember. </em>
	</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices: The font used for the website will be “Poppins”, due to it being very neutral and neat-looking. We chose to go with this font because we wanted something that would not be overwhelming to the eye of the viewer and also easily legible. Along with tha, we have decided to have a contrasting font which is only going to be used for main titles and the Homely logo. The font "Playball" is imitating a handwriting. With including that, we encorporate the homely feeling and the shortening the disctance between us and the consumer as it feels more personalized, just like our candles. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

		    <img src="images/playball font.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
			  
<li>User interface patterns:
		    The Homely website uses simple interface patterns because our style choice was to stay "minimalistic" in order to create a relaxing and calm environment without overwhelming our clients with too much details. On the very top of the page we have a <strong>navigation bar</strong> in which every page is given an appropriate title so it makes the navigation throughout the website be easy and all our product and information be accessible. By having the navigation bar on top, we make it easily navigatable throughout the website. It is error resistant, in case a user makes a wrong click, they could easily find their way back by clicking on the button they want whitin the navigation bar or just click the "go back arrow" on their web browser. Our values are presented in  <strong>cards</strong> for the user to be able to easily meet who we are as a company, rather than searching for the different values spread around the website. We have chosen cards for the shopping as well, because this way we can put our top candles that could be purchased immediately. We are also using <strong>carousel</strong> to put different information about the brand and us at the same place using graphics and links in case someone had a hard time using our navigation bar. </li>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong>: In terms of navigation, content is spread equally throughout the webpage. We made sure not to have too much content on the pages so it is not overwhelming for the viewer. As we aim for simplistic and relaxing mood, we have made sure to destribute the content accordingly. The title of each page is easily understandable of what the content within is about. We keep it as simple as possible by having a navigation bar on top with all the pages that are accesibe on our website. If user wants to go back to previous page they have been a, they simply can press the "go back arrow" at their web browser or just choose to which page they want to be sent by clicking it in the navigation bar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
            
            <li>These elements were related to the following:
              <ul>
                <li>The fit of the web design regarding our <strong>values and brand personality</strong> - Based on our values, Homely provides a save space, reminding expats of their own home and help them deal with homesickness. By working with the colors, we insure we represent our values not only verbaly but also visually. By staying minimalistic and clean with its structure, we also give our customers the home feeling of tidiness just like the comfort of their own home.&nbsp; </li>
                <li>The fit of the web design regarding our <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong> - With our marketing and communicaton strategy, we have created pages on two platforms - Facebook and Instagram. On those page, the website was promoted as well as within the website you can also find links to them. On social media as well as the website, users can find more insights on who we are as a company and what we stand for. Moreover, users can see our promotions of the products on a Instagram story or a post with a link to buy them directly from the website. Another aspect is that on both platforms we use the same colors and fonts that represent the brand. That way we can ensure that the customer remembers us visually and they will later on start recognizin us and start telling us appart from other brands.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                <li>The fit of the web design regarding our <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>- On the website regarding visuals we have aimed for smokey, pastel colored gradiants. This is representing the calmness and comfort we would like our costumers to get through our product. But before they purchase it, we would like to create a space for them on the website that they can feel our special touch to those normal candles at first glance. The colors, simplisity and the gradiant combined are stating visualy our uniqueness of the product. By having our slogan on most pictures, we do remind our customers that this is not just a candl, but there is a story behind it. Therefore, on the "Shop now" page, each candle is presented by its story rather than just the smell it is emmiting. That way we communicate our message to the customer that this is not just an ordinary aroma candle, it is a strory wrapped in a glass conainer which is just waiting for the spark to elighten it and take you to the place you have dreamed going back to.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p>Please write about&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our testing <strong>goals:</strong></li>
			  <ul>
				   <li>First of all, we want to know whether our site is easily manageable. Can users find their way through it, and achieve the goal they have set for themselves? These things depend on the set up of the website, and whether all the necessary information can be found for a user to see.</li>
				  <li>Next to that, we would like to know whether there are any errors or bugs in the code and whether our users have any suggestions as to how our website can be more user friendly.</li>
				  <li>Another thing we would like to know is whether there are any design mistakes or improvements that can be made. We, of course, want our website to work, but it also has to be visually pleasing and able to retain a user’s attention.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <li>Our testing <strong>methods:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.) - We have decided to conduct our usability testing with four different people. All of these people are matches with our target audience, meaning they're females between the ages of 25 and 35.</li>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.) - The material that is used is our website, which our participants will see through a laptop view. The usability testing is preferably conducted on campus and in person, however, if this is not possible, the testing will be conducted online. In the latter case it will be recorded through screenrecording, and the participant will be sharing their screen. If done on campus, it will be video recorded on a phone.</li>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.) - The participants will be given several different tasks for them to complete and will be asked to voice their opinions out loud, and walk us through their thinking process. If the testing is online, it will be recorded through screenrecording, and the participant will be sharing their screen. If done on campus, it will be video recorded on a phone.</li> 
              </ul>
            <li>Testing <strong>results</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Users were able to reach the goal we have set. Non of the users had trouble navigating through our website. This would have ment that users get lost searching for content, not being able to find what they are searching for, or they had trouble going back to ther start position. Out of the usability testig results we can conclude that our use of a navigation bar made it easy for them to navigate throughout our website. The using of cards was also positive as it gives more structure to the content within the website giving the simplistic feeling. The website is still not fully functional as users were trying to put products to "cart". This is an element that would frustrait users in case they already want to make a purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Future improvements would be making the website fully functional by adding a page where users could fully customize their candle of choice. Another element that has to be added is a shopping cart on the upper right corner, so whenever a user makes a purchase they can easily find it there and change/cancel. What is more, all buttons within the website should be functional, as for example the "add to cart" which is now not responding as we do not have the shopping cart element. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
